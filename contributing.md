Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Please make sure the links in your pull requests are working and point to authentic, if possible official sources.
- Generally we do not include news or opinion articles in the list as they tend not to contain information directly usable in the research.
- We accept contributions in the following categories:
  - **Medical imaging, epidemic or clinical record datasets** related to COVID-19 (imaging datasets also to pneumonia due to other causes).
  - **Statistical and deep learning models** built on the above datasets. If the model is not published there should be a clear description on how to reproduce / train the model.
  - **Scientific articles** directly helping to create such models.
  - High quality **epidemic tracking dashboards** built on official, daily updated epidemic data.
  - Official **governmental pages** for tracing the local epidemic.
  - If your contribution does not fit in the above categories but you stil feel it contains a valuable resource for the #defeatcovid19 community, open an [issue](https://github.com/defeatcovid19/awesome-covid19-resources/issues) where we can discuss it.
- By submitting a PR you waive all copyright and related or neighboring rights to your contribution.

Thank you for your suggestions!


## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
